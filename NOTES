Publication to Sonatype

#Set correct version in built.sbt, following pattern 1.2.3
#sbt publishSigned
#Then go to https://oss.sonatype.org, find the repo, 'Close' it, then 'Release'
#For best practice: tag repo on github with version using the same format "1.2.3"

For Docker:
>docker build -t galileo:0.1.1 . 
You can use something else instead of 0.1.1, or something else instead of galileo: It's just the name of the target
