Publication to Sonatype

Set the correct version in built.sbt, following pattern 0.1.2
>sbt publishSigned

Then go to https://oss.sonatype.org, find the repo, 'Close' it, then 'Release'
As a best practice, tag the repo on github with version using the same format "0.1.2"

For Docker:
>docker build -t galileo:0.1.2 . 
You can use something else instead of 0.1.2, or something else instead of galileo: It's just the name of the target
>docker run -it galileo
